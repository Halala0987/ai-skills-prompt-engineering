ai_response: "[Dear [Stakeholders' Names],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to inform you of a two-week delay in the WhatsApp integration project. We sincerely apologize for this shift in the timeline and understand the importance of timely delivery for your planning and operations.

The delay is due to a set of unforeseen technical challenges encountered during the integration phase. Specifically, we faced compatibility issues with third-party APIs and encountered unexpected behavior in message synchronization across platforms. Our development team has been actively addressing these issues to ensure a stable and secure implementation.

Revised Timeline:
We now anticipate completing the integration by [New Completion Date], with testing and quality assurance finalized shortly thereafter.

Next Steps:

We are implementing a revised development plan with additional testing checkpoints.
A detailed progress update will be shared by [Next Update Date].
We remain committed to maintaining transparency and will notify you immediately of any further changes.
We appreciate your understanding and continued support. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to schedule a check-in.
