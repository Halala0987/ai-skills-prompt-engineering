ai_response: "[Dear [Stakeholder's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

As we begin the initial stages of the new WhatsApp project, I am currently conducting a thorough requirement analysis to ensure we align our efforts with the project's goals and expectations. To proceed effectively, I would appreciate your assistance in providing some additional information and clarifications.

Specifically, it would be helpful to understand:

The primary objectives and success criteria for the WhatsApp integration.
Target user groups and any specific user journeys or use cases envisioned.
Functional requirements (e.g., messaging features, automation, integrations with existing systems).
Any compliance, security, or data privacy considerations we should be aware of.
Timelines, milestones, or dependencies that may impact the project scope.
Having this information will enable us to define a clear and actionable roadmap, identify potential risks early, and ensure that our solution meets both technical and business expectations.

Please let me know a convenient time if you'd prefer to discuss this in a brief meeting. Iâ€™m happy to accommodate your schedule.

Looking forward to your input.

Warm regards,
